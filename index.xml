<p>It felt exciting, futuristic… maybe <em>too good to be true</em>.<br>
And honestly, that’s what I’ve been thinking about ever since.</p>
<p>Because like most of you who’ve lived through long integration nights, broken APIs, and “mysterious” data mismatches — I’ve learned that <em>every shiny new thing</em> comes with its own set of “gotchas.”</p>
<p>So, in this episode, I want to take a more grounded look.<br>
Let’s unpack <strong>how MCP fits (or doesn’t)</strong> alongside something we already trust — <strong>Integration Services</strong>. For this article, I will reference to Mulesoft.</p>
<p>MuleSoft and MCP systems illustrated as interconnected structured and neural networks.</p>
<h3 id="where-we-leftoff">Where We Left Off</h3>
<p>In Episode 1, we imagined MCP as the bridge between AI reasoning and enterprise systems — something that lets an AI assistant “understand” your CRM, ERP, and knowledge systems without 100 manual connectors.</p>
<p>Now the question is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If MCP connects everything magically, what happens to MuleSoft?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was literally my first question too.</p>
<p>After exploring a few prototypes and talking with architects, the answer became clearer — it’s not a replacement story. It’s a partnership story.<br>
They just play different roles in the same orchestra.</p>
<h3 id="structured-logic-vs-adaptive-reasoning">Structured Logic vs. Adaptive Reasoning</h3>
<p><img alt="MuleSoft is reliable and deterministic, MCP is adaptive and AI-driven\u200a—\u200aboth have strengths and trade-offs." loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*se0-0QADm-XGexQObePvLg.png"></p>
<p>MuleSoft is reliable and deterministic, MCP is adaptive and AI-driven — both have strengths and trade-offs.</p>
<p>You can already sense it — <strong>MuleSoft is structure</strong>, while <strong>MCP is spontaneity</strong>.<br>
Both are needed, but not always together — and definitely not without some thought.</p>
<h3 id="when-mcp-feels-like-magic-and-a-littlerisky">When MCP Feels Like Magic (and a Little Risky)</h3>
<p>I tried imagining real-world moments where MCP would shine.<br>
Say a sales rep asks an AI assistant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why are my Q3 deals lower than last year?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, with MCP, that assistant can pull from Salesforce opportunities, marketing leads, and even customer sentiment data — all in real time.<br>
No need to wait for an ETL job. It’s reasoning on the fly.</p>
<p>It <em>feels</em> like magic — until it’s not.</p>
<p>Because if your data definitions aren’t consistent, or if the AI picks the wrong context (say, interpreting “closed deals” differently in two systems), the answer might sound confident but be completely wrong.</p>
<p>That’s when you realize — reasoning without governance can be dangerous.<br>
I’ve started seeing this pattern already: <strong>MCP needs boundaries, not just access.</strong></p>
<p>So, while it’s great for <em>insights, recommendations,</em> and <em>exploration</em>, I wouldn’t trust it (yet) for structured data sync or compliance-heavy flows.</p>
<h3 id="when-mulesoft-still-has-the-upperhand">When MuleSoft Still Has the Upper Hand</h3>
<p>Here’s where MuleSoft still quietly saves the day.</p>
<p>Picture your monthly customer data sync — ERP, Salesforce, and a data lake.<br>
You’ve got mappings, validations, transformations, error retries, all running like clockwork.</p>
<p>Now imagine replacing that with an AI reasoning layer that <em>decides</em> when and how to sync based on “context.”<br>
Sounds flexible — but it also sounds like a Friday-night deployment waiting to go wrong. 😅</p>
<p>This is where <strong>MuleSoft’s determinism wins</strong>.<br>
You <em>know</em> what’s happening.<br>
You can trace it, audit it, control it.</p>
<p>That level of predictability is priceless — especially when your CFO is asking, “Why did the revenue numbers suddenly change in the dashboard?”</p>
<h3 id="the-hybrid-reality-mulesoft--mcp--intelligent-integration-fabric">The Hybrid Reality: “MuleSoft + MCP = Intelligent Integration Fabric”</h3>
<p>The most exciting part, though, is when these two work <em>together</em>.<br>
That’s where I see real potential.</p>
<p>Think of MuleSoft as your <strong>trusted integration backbone</strong>, exposing clean, secure APIs.<br>
Then, MCP acts as the <strong>intelligent front-end</strong> that <em>reasons</em> when and why to use those APIs.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>MuleSoft exposes “Customer Order APIs.”</li>
<li>MCP consumes them as <strong>Tools</strong>, calling them only when contextually relevant.</li>
<li>The AI doesn’t replace the flow — it <em>triggers it intelligently.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, instead of data just flowing, it’s <em>thinking while flowing.</em><br>
That’s the <strong>Intelligent Integration Fabric</strong> — predictable where it should be, adaptive where it can be.</p>
<h3 id="but-its-not-all-smoothyet">But It’s Not All Smooth Yet</h3>
<p>There are still rough edges.<br>
<em>- Governance models for AI-triggered calls are immature.<br>
- Cost monitoring (especially for AI-based reasoning requests) can get unpredictable.<br>
- And tracing “why” an AI chose a particular API call? That’s still a mystery box.</em></p>
<p>So I’ve started thinking of MCP as something you <strong>layer on carefully</strong> — experiment with side-by-side integrations, not mission-critical ones (yet).</p>
<p>Because as exciting as AI orchestration sounds, sometimes a <em>boring</em>, predictable flow is your best friend.</p>
<h3 id="the-roadahead">The Road Ahead</h3>
<p>As enterprises evolve, I think we’ll start seeing <strong>MuleSoft APIs exposed as MCP Tools</strong> — a bridge where AI can reason on top of structured integrations.</p>
<p>In that world, MuleSoft remains the “spine,” and MCP becomes the “brain.”<br>
And maybe that’s how we build the next generation of connected, intelligent enterprises — <em>one careful step at a time.</em></p>
<h3 id="-nextup">🚀 Next Up</h3>
<p>In <strong>Episode 3 — “Building an AI-Connected Enterprise with Salesforce and MCP”</strong>,<br>
I’ll explore how all of this ties together — from reasoning agents to integration fabrics — <br>
and what it means for architects who are designing the next phase of enterprise intelligence.</p>
<p>Until then, I’ll keep tinkering, testing, and probably breaking a few sandboxes in the process.<br>
Because that’s how we really learn, right?</p>

In the “Build vs. Buy” debate, the answer overwhelmingly leaned toward <strong>Buy</strong>.</p>
<p>We adopted Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow, and other SaaS platforms because they were secure, scalable, and significantly cheaper and faster than building enterprise systems from scratch. The costs, maintenance, and complexity of custom systems made SaaS the pragmatic choice.</p>
<p>But a shift is underway. Enterprises are beginning to ask a deeper question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What if the real power isn’t in the cloud you buy — but in the platform beneath it?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="why-now">Why Now</h3>
<p>This shift is being driven by two major industry-wide transformations:</p>
<h3 id="1-the-maturing-of-in-housetalent">1. The Maturing of In-House Talent</h3>
<p>Ten years ago, large engineering teams were mostly found in tech companies.<br>
Today — banks, retailers, manufacturers, insurers, logistics companies — <strong>every enterprise is a technology company</strong>.</p>
<p>This is fueling the <strong>Platform Engineering megatrend</strong>.</p>
<p>Gartner predicts that by <strong>2026</strong>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>80% of large software engineering organizations will establish platform engineering teams.</strong>(<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-11-28-gartner-hype-cycle-shows-ai-practices-and-platform-engineering-will-reach-mainstream-adoption-in-software-engineering-in-two-to-five-years">Gartner — Top Strategic Technology Trends</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These teams build <strong>Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)</strong> to standardize how enterprise engineers build systems internally. They’re no longer simple “software consumers” — they’re sophisticated builders.</p>
<p>Gartner has also continued to advocate for <strong>composable architecture</strong>, aligned to modularity, speed, and reuse.</p>
<p>And another key data point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>By 2027, 50% of enterprise software engineers will use ML-powered coding tools.</strong> (<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-11-28-gartner-hype-cycle-shows-ai-practices-and-platform-engineering-will-reach-mainstream-adoption-in-software-engineering-in-two-to-five-years">Gartner — Software Engineering Trends</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2-the-rise-of-ai-as-a-developer">2. The Rise of AI as a Developer</h3>
<p>Generative AI is completely reshaping the economics of software development.</p>
<p><strong>AI now:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Writes large portions of production-grade code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Builds tests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generates documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improves code quality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduces long-term maintenance overhead</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The old barriers that made “Build” expensive are eroding quickly.</p>
<p>AI means that building is no longer a high-cost, long-term liability — it’s becoming a <strong>strategic advantage</strong>, especially when the solution differentiates your business.</p>
<h3 id="not-just-a-return-to-build-vsbuy">Not Just a Return to “Build vs. Buy”</h3>
<p>Some frame this shift as reopening the old debate. But this is bigger. This is not “Build” versus “Buy.” This is a <strong>new model</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Buy the Platform. Build the Differentiation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are entering the <strong>Platform Renaissance</strong>, aligned with what Gartner calls the <strong>Composable Enterprise</strong> — a world where organizations assemble capabilities like Lego blocks.</p>
<h3 id="the-ai-powered-platform-first-opportunity">The AI-Powered Platform-First Opportunity</h3>
<p>The future of enterprise IT isn’t in vertical SaaS apps. It’s in platforms that empower organizations to build what truly differentiates them. SaaS vendors can evolve by offering:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Horizontal Capabilities: Workflow engines, Analytics, AI automation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extensible building blocks: data models, UI templates, SDKs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open composition: customers assemble apps themselves</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead of selling <strong>Service Cloud v3</strong>, vendors could provide: A secure, metadata-driven, AI-native platform where enterprise engineers and citizen developers build their own solutions — fast. This enables enterprises to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Maintain innovation speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid vendor lock-in</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce expensive custom rebuilds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use vendor strengths while building unique IP</p>
</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-new-opportunity-unbundle-dontreplace">The New Opportunity: Unbundle, Don’t Replace</h3>
<p>This shift isn’t about discarding existing systems.</p>
<p>It’s about <strong>unbundling them</strong>.</p>
<p>A very telling example: A recent job posting for a <em>Salesforce Developer (AI/Einstein)</em> didn’t simply ask for app admin skills. It asked for the ability to:</p>
<p><em>“Design, build, and productionize Salesforce-native AI features and Build on-platform AI capabilities”</em></p>
<p>That job description reflects what enterprises actually want from SaaS vendors today —</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Give us your governance, security, reliability, and world-class AI stack.<br>
And give us the freedom to build the last-mile differentiation ourselves.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>SaaS vendors that pivot from “product providers” to <strong>platform enablers</strong> will define the next decade of enterprise software.</p>
<p>They will become the <strong>foundation layer</strong> for AI-driven, customizable enterprise applications.</p>
<h3 id="vendors-best-positioned-tolead">Vendors Best Positioned to Lead</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Salesforce:</strong> Already progressing toward a metadata-first, AI-native extensible platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Microsoft:</strong> Power Platform + Azure offer some of the strongest building-block primitives in the market.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>ServiceNow:</strong> Now Platform increasingly resembles a modular business OS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oracle:</strong> Fusion Cloud + Oracle’s developer tooling make it a strong contender for platform-driven enterprise architectures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“The future of enterprise IT isn’t just what you buy.<br>
It’s what you can build on top of it.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next decade of enterprise software won’t be defined by the tools we buy, but by the platforms we build upon.</p>
<p>The real question for CIOs, architects, and product leaders now is simple:<br>
<em><strong>Will your organization be a consumer of SaaS — or a creator of strategic advantage?</strong></em></p>

<p>This 4-part series explores how enterprise integrations are evolving from traditional APIs and middleware to something smarter — <strong>AI MCP (Model Context Protocol)</strong> — a new way for systems to communicate <em>intelligently</em>.</p>
<p>(In this first episode, we’ll explore what MCP is, why it matters, and how it changes the way we think about integration.)</p>
<h3 id="the-integration-story-we-allknow"><strong>The Integration Story We All Know</strong></h3>
<p>If you’ve ever worked in enterprise systems, you know this feeling:</p>
<p>Every time a new tool enters the ecosystem, someone says, “We just need an integration.”</p>
<p>And before you know it — you’re managing a spaghetti bowl of APIs, middleware, and connectors that all <em>kinda work</em>… until they don’t.</p>
<p>We’ve all been there.</p>
<p>For years, <em>integration</em> has been the silent backbone of digital transformation — connecting CRMs, ERPs, support tools, and data lakes.</p>
<p>We’ve built those connections through APIs, ETL scripts, and platforms like MuleSoft/Bhoomi. They were reliable, repeatable, and predictable.</p>
<p>But then, something changed.</p>
<h3 id="the-rise-of-aiand-why-our-integrations-suddenly-feltdumb"><strong>The Rise of AI — and Why Our Integrations Suddenly Felt Dumb</strong></h3>
<p>When AI entered the chat (pun intended), we realized something strange.</p>
<p>Our systems were connected, but they weren’t <em>thinking together</em>.</p>
<p>Imagine this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your CRM knows what the customer bought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your support system knows what the customer complained about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your email system knows how your rep responded.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But none of them share <em>context</em>.</p>
<p>That’s when you realize — the problem isn’t that your systems aren’t integrated.</p>
<p>It’s that your integrations aren’t intelligent.</p>
<h3 id="enter-mcp-the-model-contextprotocol"><strong>Enter MCP: The Model Context Protocol</strong></h3>
<p>Now, let’s talk about the new kid on the block: <strong>MCP, or Model Context Protocol.</strong></p>
<p>Sounds fancy, right? But here’s the simple version:</p>
<p><em>MCP is like a</em> <em><strong>universal translator</strong></em> <em>(or a standard set of rules) that allows AI agents to safely discover and talk to tools, apps, and systems — and actually</em> do <em>things.</em></p>
<p>Instead of hardcoding every API call or building middleware flows, you define <strong>“tools” — standardized, discoverable actions</strong> that tell the AI what actions are possible (e.g., <code>create_jira_ticket</code>, <code>get_customer_status</code>) and how to use them.</p>
<p>So rather than a integration service flow that says:</p>
<p>“When record is updated in ERP → push update to CRM,”</p>
<p>you could have an <strong>AI agent</strong> that <em>decides</em> when to do it, <em>why</em> it’s needed, and even <em>how</em> to summarize or enrich the data… and then uses MCP to execute the action.</p>
<p><strong>If the AI is the “brain,” MCP is the universal “nervous system”</strong> that connects that brain to all your different system “limbs” in a language they all understand.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sounds almost magical, right? But MCP is still early. Standards are forming, tooling is evolving, and enterprises will need to answer tough questions — how do you govern AI-driven actions? How do you audit what the agent did, and why?<br>
These are the grey zones that make this shift exciting and a little daunting — something I’ll unpack in later episodes.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="why-itmatters"><strong>Why It Matters</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s step back for a moment.</p>
<p>When we built integrations before, they were <strong>deterministic</strong>. You could trace the logic step by step.</p>
<p>MCP enables <strong>reasoning</strong> — allowing an AI agent to decide <em>what</em> to do based on context, not just a pre-programmed trigger.</p>
<p>Think of it this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>APIs</strong> connect systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integration layer (like MuleSoft)</strong> orchestrates systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MCP</strong> lets an AI agent <em>reason about</em> and <em>command</em> systems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a big shift.</p>
<p>It means instead of wiring a thousand specific automations, you could expose a few well-defined tools — and let AI handle the orchestration dynamically.</p>
<p><em><strong>Of course, reasoning-driven integrations come with trade-offs. Deterministic flows are predictable; AI reasoning isn’t always. When something fails, where do you debug — the agent’s decision logic, or the tool it invoked?<br>
That tension between flexibility and control will define how ready enterprises really are for MCP.</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="a-quickexample"><strong>A Quick Example</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s say your company uses Salesforce, Slack, and Jira.</p>
<p><strong>Today, you might:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build a MuleSoft flow that updates Jira when a Salesforce case hits “Escalated.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use an ETL job to sync case data to Slack for the support team.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>With MCP, a new workflow is possible:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <strong>AI Agent (the “brain”)</strong> <em>Detects</em> negative sentiment from customer emails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It <em>Summarizes</em> recent Slack discussions about that customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It <em>Decides</em> the issue needs escalation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, using the <strong>MCP protocol (the “nervous system”)</strong>, it finds and executes the pre-defined tools:<br>
<code>- create_ticket</code> in Jira.<br>
<code>- notify_channel</code> in Slack, including its own summary.</p>
<p>No hard-coded flow. Just <strong>context + reasoning + action</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="open-mcp-vs-enterprise-mcp"><strong>Open MCP vs. Enterprise MCP</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s where things get interesting.</p>
<p>There are two worlds emerging:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Open MCP</strong> — a community-driven, open protocol where you can define your own tools and host them anywhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enterprise MCP</strong> — A vendor’s enterprise-grade version (like what Salesforce is building with its <strong>Agentforce MCP/Agentforce 360</strong> concept), integrated with their ecosystem and AI Trust Layer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Think of <strong>Open MCP</strong> like open-source Lego blocks — flexible and free, but you need to assemble, host, and secure them yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise MCP</strong> is like buying the official Lego set — integrated, supported, and comes with enterprise-grade fit, finish, and guardrails.</p>
<p><em><strong>But not every organization will jump to this model overnight. Governance, compliance, data access, and trust boundaries will play a huge role in how fast MCP matures.<br>
And let’s be honest — some industries (like finance or healthcare) will move cautiously, balancing innovation with risk.</strong></em></p>
<p>In the next episode, we’ll explore exactly how those two worlds meet — and where platforms like MuleSoft still shine.</p>
<h3 id="the-biggerpicture"><strong>The Bigger Picture</strong></h3>
<p>Every decade, integration evolves —</p>
<p>![](<a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1</a>*J4UdhYTTJaF8Fj2Cgu6luQ.png align=&ldquo;left&rdquo;)</p>
<p>We’re not throwing away APIs or integration services like MuleSoft. Far from it.</p>
<p>They’re just becoming part of a larger picture — a connected enterprise where AI doesn’t just <em>call</em> systems, it <em>understands</em> them.</p>
<p>The truth is — we’re still figuring out where AI-driven orchestration ends and traditional integration begins. And that’s okay. Every tech wave starts messy before it becomes mainstream.</p>
<h3 id="closing-thought"><strong>Closing Thought</strong></h3>
<p>If APIs were highways connecting your systems, <strong>MCP is the intelligent traffic control tower</strong> — managing how AI-driven agents move across those highways safely and efficiently.</p>
<p>We’ve spent years wiring data pipelines. Now it’s time to give them brains… and the nervous system to connect them.</p>
<h3 id="coming-next"><strong>Coming Next</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Episode 2: “MCP vs Integration Services: Friends, Not Foes”</strong> — a deep dive into how both coexist and complement each other in modern enterprises.</p>
<p>This whole space is evolving fast — and every architect, developer, and AI tinkerer sees it from a different angle.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What do you think about MCP’s role in the future of enterprise integrations?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Would you trust AI to make integration decisions?</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, it sounds like another big buzzword moment. But if you look closer, Salesforce is signalling something much deeper — a shift from “AI features” to AI teammates that work <em>with</em> us, not just <em>for</em> us.</p>
<h3 id="whats-new-with-agentforce-360">What’s New with Agentforce 360</h3>
<p>Agentforce 360 is Salesforce’s biggest AI leap yet. It’s not just about embedding AI inside the CRM; it’s about giving companies the tools to <strong>build their own AI agents</strong> — securely and at scale.</p>
<p>In short, businesses can now:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create <strong>low-code or no-code AI agents</strong> that automate tasks inside Salesforce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let those agents connect with tools like Slack, Service Cloud, or even Google Workspace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control it all through Salesforce’s built-in governance and trust layer.(<a href="https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-unveils-agentforce-360-at-dreamforce-with-new-features-including-voice/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Source: SalesforceBen</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And some early adopters — like <strong>Williams-Sonoma, Inc.</strong> and <strong>Wiley</strong> — are already rolling this out to support their customer service teams. (<a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Williams-Sonoma-Inc--Deploys-Salesforce-Agentforce-360-Across-Its-Brand-Portfolio-Elevating-Its-Premium-Customer-Support-and-Experiences-to-the-Next-Level/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Source: Salesforce Investor News</a>)</p>
<h3 id="butheres-thereality">But…Here’s the Reality</h3>
<p>Agentforce 360 is a strong foundation — but it’s not the full story.<br>
Most enterprise workflows don’t live only inside Salesforce. They stretch across marketing tools, ERPs, data platforms, in-house systems and project management systems.</p>
<p>That’s where the real opportunity lies — <em><strong>cross-system AI agents</strong></em> that go beyond CRM and handle the messy, repetitive work that slows teams down.</p>
<h3 id="some-real-world-agentideas">Some Real-World Agent Ideas</h3>
<p>Here are a few AI agent ideas that could easily plug into or extend the Agentforce vision — ones I think could make a real difference for enterprise teams:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Lead-to-Account Intelligence Agent:</strong> B2B leads often already belong to existing accounts. This agent auto-detects duplicates, routes leads correctly, and merges data — aligning sales and marketing without endless manual cleanup. — <em>A RevOps analyst that never sleeps.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pipeline Sanity Agent:</strong> Forecasts go off-track when data gets stale. This agent reviews open opportunities, checks for missing details or inconsistent stages, and pings reps in Slack with quick nudges. — <em>Keeps your pipeline honest — and your manager happy</em> 😊*.*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implementation Tracker Agent:</strong> Once a deal closes, chaos usually begins. This agent auto-creates onboarding projects in Jira or Asana, tracks milestones, and updates Salesforce as work progresses. — <em>A simple way to bridge sales and delivery.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Customer Health Agent:</strong> By analyzing CRM activity, support cases, and even sentiment, this agent predicts customer churn risk and alerts CSMs in advance. — <em>A smart co-pilot for customer success.</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="building-on-agentforcenot-competing-withit">Building on Agentforce — Not Competing with It</h3>
<p>Salesforce designed Agentforce 360 to be <strong>open and extendable</strong> — that’s the best part. It gives developers and architects the secure foundation to build their own AI agents that can pull context, automate decisions, and orchestrate workflows across platforms.</p>
<p>![](<a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1</a>*l0WHRDJ7yT3WJxkjQMKJHA.png align=&ldquo;left&rdquo;)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Agentforce 360 gives every company the power to become an Agentic Enterprise.”<br>
 —</em> <a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/news/news-details/2025/Welcome-to-the-Agentic-Enterprise-With-Agentforce-360-Salesforce-Elevates-Human-Potential-in-the-Age-of-AI/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com"><em>Marc Benioff, Dreamforce 2025 Keynote</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means instead of just using Salesforce’s built-in agents, we can build <em>our own</em>, tailor-made for our business needs.</p>
<h3 id="the-bigger-picture-what-the-agentic-enterprise-reallymeans">The Bigger Picture: What the “Agentic Enterprise” Really Means</h3>
<p>The idea of an “Agentic Enterprise” isn’t about replacing people — it’s about amplifying them.<br>
It’s a workplace where every employee has a few AI agents quietly taking care of the repetitive stuff: gathering context, writing follow-ups, syncing data, or analyzing signals.</p>
<p>As Benioff said at Dreamforce,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Innovation is far exceeding customer adoption. The opportunity now is to operationalize the power of these agents across the enterprise.”<br>
 —</em> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/salesforce-ceo-says-ai-innovation-is-far-exceeding-customer-adoption-2025-10?utm_source=chatgpt.com"><em>Business Insider, Oct 2025</em></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That gap between <em>what’s possible</em> and <em>what’s actually implemented</em> is where builders — especially Salesforce architects, admins, and AI enthusiasts — can make a huge impact.</p>
<h3 id="my-takeaway">My Takeaway</h3>
<p>![](<a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1</a>*15RzmitI8z0K0_9pEtVD2A.png align=&ldquo;left&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Salesforce just gave us the playbook and the platform. Now it’s on us to build the next layer — the specialized, cross-system AI agents that make real business impact.</p>
<p>We’re entering an era where automation becomes orchestration — and data turns into action through intelligent collaboration between humans and machines.</p>
<p>That, to me, is the real Agentic Enterprise. Love to hear your take on this &amp; especially the ideas I listed above.</p>

&lt;p&gt;You copy and paste, you try to summarize the key points, you search for the right Account or Opportunity, and you create a Task. It’s a tedious, time-consuming process that’s universally disliked yet essential for maintaining a clear customer record.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="how-a-custom-outlook-add-in-azure-functions-and-ai-can-eliminate-manual-data-entry-and-create-perfect-crm-notes-or-tasks-everytime">How a custom Outlook Add-in, Azure Functions, and AI can eliminate manual data entry and create perfect CRM notes or tasks every time.</h3>
<p>Every professional who uses a CRM has felt this pain. You finish an important email exchange with a client — full of critical details, action items, and subtle sentiment cues — and then comes the administrative tax: logging it all in Salesforce.</p>
<p>You copy and paste, you try to summarize the key points, you search for the right Account or Opportunity, and you create a Task. It’s a tedious, time-consuming process that’s universally disliked yet essential for maintaining a clear customer record.</p>
<p>I decided to build a better way. What if you could capture the essence of an email, link it to the right Salesforce record, and create a perfectly formatted note with a single click?</p>
<p>This is the story of how I built a custom “Copilot” to do just that.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-the-crm-tax-is-costing-us-more-than-justtime">The Problem: The “CRM Tax” is Costing Us More Than Just Time</h3>
<p>The friction of manual data entry isn’t just an annoyance; it has real business consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Lost Information:</strong> Key details are often missed when summarizing long email threads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inconsistent Data:</strong> Everyone logs notes differently, making reports unreliable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Wasted Time:</strong> Our sales and service teams were spending hours on administrative work instead of engaging with customers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-about-native-solutions-the-limits-of-einstein-activitycapture">What About Native Solutions? The Limits of Einstein Activity Capture</h3>
<p>“But wait,” you might ask, “doesn’t Salesforce already have a tool for this with Einstein Activity Capture?”</p>
<p>It’s a fair question. EAC is great at what it does: automatically syncing your emails and events to the Salesforce timeline. It solves the problem of <em>getting the data in</em>. The problem is, it just creates a digital copy of the email. For any busy sales rep looking back at a six-month-old opportunity, the activity timeline is a wall of text — a dozen logged emails they have to re-read to find the one crucial detail they need.</p>
<p><strong>EAC provides a record, but it doesn’t provide meaning.</strong></p>
<p>We didn’t just want to store emails; we wanted to distill them into intelligence. The value isn’t in having the email record, it’s in having a scannable, action-oriented summary that tells you what matters in seconds. That’s the gap our solution is designed to fill.</p>
<h3 id="the-solution-a-smart-outlookadd-in">THE Solution: A Smart Outlook Add-in</h3>
<p>The solution is a simple but powerful Office Add-in that lives directly within Outlook. It automates the entire workflow in a few seconds.</p>
<p>Here’s what it does:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>It reads the email context,</strong> including the subject, body, and all attendees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>It automatically finds the right Salesforce Account</strong> by matching attendee emails with Salesforce Contacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With one click, it sends the email content to an AI to <strong>generate a structured summary.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, it saves that summary as a Task linked to the correct Salesforce Account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What used to be a five-minute, multi-step process now takes less than 10 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="the-user-experience-inaction">The User Experience in Action</h3>
<p>Watch the workflow unfold in this screen recording. When an email is opened, the <strong>“Save to Salesforce”</strong> add-in activates in the task pane.</p>
<p>It immediately gets to work, analyzing the attendees’ emails. You’ll notice it automatically queries Salesforce in the background and presents the matching accounts, pre-selecting the most probable one.</p>
<p>Next, the user clicks <strong>“Generate Summary”</strong>. This sends the email content securely to our AI backend. In just a moment, the structured summary — formatted exactly as we defined with Action Items, Important Points, and more — appears directly in the add-in, ready for review.</p>
<p>After a quick review (or edits, if needed), the user clicks <strong>“Save to Salesforce”</strong>. The system confirms the task has been successfully created and linked to the chosen account in Salesforce.</p>
<p>As you can see, the entire interaction is logged accurately and intelligently in Salesforce in a matter of seconds, transforming a tedious manual task into a seamless, efficient action.</p>
<h3 id="the-architecture-how-it-allworks">The Architecture: How It All Works</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Frontend (Office Add-in):</strong> A simple web application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) built using the standard <code>yo office</code> generator. It runs inside Outlook and is responsible for the user interface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backend (Azure Functions):</strong> A serverless Python application that acts as the brain. It has three key jobs:<br>
- <strong>Find Accounts:</strong> Takes attendee emails and queries Salesforce to find matching records.<br>
- <strong>Generate Summary:</strong> Securely calls the Azure AI (or Gemini) API with a custom prompt to summarize the email text.<br>
- <strong>Save to Salesforce:</strong> Authenticates to Salesforce using a secure JWT flow and creates the final Task record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Salesforce (Connected App):</strong> A secure entry point that allows our backend to communicate with the Salesforce API without ever storing user passwords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Azure AI / Google AI:</strong> The AI engine that provides the summarization capabilities. Our detailed prompt engineering ensures the output is always structured and consistent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Using a serverless function as the middleware is the key to making this scalable and cost-effective. We only pay for the few seconds the code is running, and the same backend can be used to support future add-ins for other platforms like Gmail or Teams.</p>
<h3 id="lessons-learned--whatsnext">Lessons Learned &amp; What’s Next</h3>
<p>Building this tool was a journey through modern web development, from frontend UI and browser security (CORS is never fun!) to backend authentication and AI integration. The biggest takeaway is that with the right architecture, you can create incredibly powerful automations that solve real-world business problems.</p>
<p>The future possibilities are even more exciting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Proactive Suggestions:</strong> The AI could analyze the summary and suggest the next best action or draft a follow-up email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-Platform Support:</strong> The backend is ready to support a Gmail Add-on or a Microsoft Teams extension with minimal changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deeper Salesforce Integration:</strong> We could expand it to create other record types, like Opportunities or Cases, directly from an email.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By automating the “CRM tax,” we’re not just saving time; we’re empowering our teams to focus on what they do best: building relationships with customers.</p>
<h3 id="introducing-version-2-smarter-more-flexible-integration">Introducing Version 2: Smarter, More Flexible Integration</h3>
<p>Building on the foundation of our initial Copilot, we listened to feedback and pushed the intelligence further. Version 2 introduces several key enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic Account Matching:</strong> The add-in now intelligently suggests the most likely Salesforce Account(s) by matching email attendees to your Contacts, reducing manual searching.</li>
</ul>
<p>![](<a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1</a>*yaV2yisxN8xWHxI27Eaiag.png align=&ldquo;center&rdquo;)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual Record Search:</strong> If no match is found, or if you need to relate the summary elsewhere, you can now easily search for Accounts, Contacts, Opportunities, or Cases directly within the add-in.</li>
</ul>
<p>![](<a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1</a>*kAj6MgaPW45txmVKf_UaKA.png align=&ldquo;center&rdquo;)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Save as Task or Note:</strong> You now have the flexibility to save the AI summary as either a Salesforce Task or a structured Note (<code>ContentNote</code>), depending on your workflow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smart Case Comment Creation:</strong> When linking to a Salesforce Case, the add-in automatically creates a Case Comment, keeping the conversation threaded correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Refined UI:</strong> The interface is cleaner, hiding the summary until generated and integrating the record search more seamlessly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These updates move the tool beyond simple summarization towards a more context-aware and adaptable assistant, making the process of logging email interactions even more efficient and accurate.</p>

<p>If you’ve experienced this, you’re not alone. This behaviour isn’t a bug; it’s a deliberate design choice by Salesforce that, once understood, can unlock a more powerful and intuitive pipeline analysis experience. Let’s break down the distinct roles of these two filter areas and how to master their interaction.</p>
<p>![Salesforce Pipeline Inspection with Filter options](<a href="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1763844413728/3d9f9c53-5213-4c29-af7c-d593c542ef1f.gif">https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1763844413728/3d9f9c53-5213-4c29-af7c-d593c542ef1f.gif</a> align=&ldquo;center&rdquo;)</p>
<h3 id="meet-the-players-preset-filters-vs-showfilters">Meet the Players: Preset Filters vs. “Show Filters”</h3>
<p>Salesforce Pipeline Inspection gives you two primary ways to slice and dice your pipeline data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Preset Filters (Top of the Page): The Broad Strokes</strong> Located prominently at the very top of your Pipeline Inspection screen, these are your high-level, overarching filters. They define the <strong>core dataset</strong> you’re looking at. You’ll typically find options like:<br>
- <strong>Close Date Range:</strong> (e.g., This Quarter, Next Quarter, Current Month)<br>
- <strong>Changes Since:</strong> (e.g., Start of Period, Last 7 Days)<br>
- <strong>Owner/Team:</strong> (e.g., My Opportunities, My Team’s Opportunities)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Any change you make here immediately and directly refreshes the entire summary (New, Increased, Decreased, etc.) and the list of opportunities displayed below.</strong> These are your go-to for setting the primary time horizon and ownership scope of your pipeline review.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The “Show Filters” (Three-Lines Icon/Panel on the Right): The Fine Details</strong> Clicking the three horizontal lines icon on the right side of the screen reveals a slide-out panel. This area provides <strong>granular filtering options</strong> that are similar to what you’d find in a standard Salesforce list view. Here, you can add more specific criteria to further refine the opportunities <em>within</em> the dataset already defined by your Preset Filters. Examples include:<br>
<code>Opportunity Stage Amount Account Name Opportunity Record Type</code> Any custom fields relevant to your sales process (e.g., <code>Product Family</code>, <code>Lead Source</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-dont-they-sync-its-about-flexibility">Why Don’t They Sync? It’s About Flexibility!</h3>
<p>The key to understanding this apparent disconnect lies in their distinct purposes and Salesforce’s commitment to user control.</p>
<p>Imagine you’re an avid book collector.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Your Preset Filter is like choosing a bookshelf:</strong> You select “Fiction” or “Non-Fiction.” This immediately changes the set of books you’re looking at.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your “Show Filters” are like a detailed search <em>within</em> that bookshelf:</strong> You might search for “Mysteries” or “Books by Lisa.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if you switch your bookshelf from “Fiction” to “Non-Fiction,” you wouldn’t necessarily want your specific “Mysteries” search term to disappear, would you? You might still want to search for “Mysteries” within the Non-Fiction section (e.g., true crime mysteries!).</p>
<p>Salesforce Pipeline Inspection works similarly:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Distinct Purposes:</strong> The Preset Filters define the universe of opportunities you’re examining (e.g., all opportunities closing this quarter). The “Show Filters” then allow you to drill down into specific subsets <em>within that universe</em> (e.g., only those opportunities in the “Value Proposition” stage).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Control:</strong> This separation provides immense flexibility. You can quickly switch your core time period (via Preset Filters) and still have your detailed “Show Filters” (like filtering by a specific industry or product type) ready to apply to the new dataset without having to re-select them every time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong> Automatically re-applying and synchronizing every granular filter with every top-level change could also impact performance, especially in larger organizations with extensive pipelines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="putting-it-into-practice-examples">Putting It Into Practice: Examples</h3>
<p>Let’s walk through a common scenario to illustrate this behaviour:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: Refining Your Q2 Pipeline</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial Setup:</strong> Open Pipeline Inspection.<br>
- <strong>Preset Filters:</strong> Set <strong>Close Date Range</strong> to <code>This Quarter</code>, <strong>Changes Since</strong> to <code>Start of Period</code>, and <strong>Owner</strong> to <code>My Team</code>.<br>
- The dashboard updates to show your team’s pipeline for this quarter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adding Detail with “Show Filters”:</strong> You want to focus only on late-stage deals.<br>
- Click the three-lines icon to open the <strong>“Show Filters”</strong> panel.<br>
- Add a filter: <code>Stage EQUALS Value Proposition, Negotiation, Closed Won</code>.<br>
- The list of opportunities <em>below</em> the summary metrics now only shows deals in those stages, within your team, for this quarter.<br>
- <em>Notice:</em> The “Show Filters” panel now visibly displays “Stage: Value Proposition, Negotiation, Closed Won.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Changing the Core Scope (Preset Filter Change):</strong> Now you want to look at Next Quarter’s pipeline with the same stage focus.<br>
- You change the <strong>Preset Filter</strong> for <strong>Close Date Range</strong> from <code>This Quarter</code> to <code>Next Quarter</code>.<br>
- The summary metrics and opportunity list <strong>immediately update</strong> to show your team’s deals for next quarter.<br>
- <strong>Crucially, if you open the “Show Filters” panel again, you’ll still see “Stage: Value Proposition, Negotiation, Closed Won” displayed.</strong> This filter is still active and is now applying to the <code>Next Quarter</code> dataset. The panel didn&rsquo;t reset, but its filter logic is now applied to the new scope.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: The “Show Filters” Panel Retains State</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Initial Filter:</strong> You’re looking at your opportunities.<br>
- <strong>Preset Filters:</strong> Default to <code>This Quarter</code>, <code>Start of Period</code>, <code>Me</code>.<br>
- <strong>“Show Filters”:</strong> Open the panel and add <code>Amount GREATER OR EQUAL TO $100,000</code>. The list updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Navigating Away and Back:</strong> You navigate to a different Salesforce tab (e.g., Accounts), do some work, and then navigate back to Pipeline Inspection.<br>
- <strong>Preset Filters:</strong> Will likely revert to their default or last saved view settings (e.g., <code>This Quarter</code>).<br>
- <strong>“Show Filters”:</strong> When you open the side panel, you will <strong>still see</strong> <code>**Amount GREATER OR EQUAL TO $100,000**</code> <strong>visible and active</strong>. The &ldquo;Show Filters&rdquo; panel tends to retain its last-applied state <em>for your user session</em>, even if the underlying data set (from Preset Filters) has changed or reset to default.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="master-your-pipelineviews">Master Your Pipeline Views</h3>
<p>Understanding this distinct behaviour is key to efficiently managing your pipeline. Here are the best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Start Broad, Then Refine:</strong> Always begin by setting your <strong>Preset Filters</strong> to establish the primary time period and ownership scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drill Down with “Show Filters”:</strong> Use the <strong>“Show Filters”</strong> panel to add your specific criteria for deeper analysis within that defined scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Save Your Custom Views!</strong> This is the ultimate power move. If you frequently use a specific combination of <strong>both Preset Filters AND “Show Filters”</strong>, save it as a custom Pipeline View. This ensures that every time you select that saved view, all your desired filters (both top-level and granular) are applied instantly. This consistency is invaluable for reporting and analysis.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By recognizing the independent yet complementary roles of these two filter areas, you can stop fighting Pipeline Inspection and start truly making it work for you. No more mysteries, just clear, actionable insights into your sales pipeline!</p>

<p>If that sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Pipeline Inspection is a powerful tool for sales leaders and reps, offering dynamic insights into pipeline health. But its “Changes Since” filter, particularly how it calculates “Moved In” and “Moved Out” opportunities, can sometimes feel like a magic trick. Today, we’re pulling back the curtain on that magic, using a real-world scenario to explain exactly what’s going on.</p>
<h3 id="first-a-quick-recap-the-coreconcepts">First, A Quick Recap: The Core Concepts</h3>
<p>Before we dive into the puzzle, let’s ensure we’re on the same page with two fundamental Salesforce concepts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Close Date:</strong> This is the anticipated (for open deals) or actual (for closed deals) date by which an opportunity is expected to be won or lost. It’s the heartbeat of your sales forecast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pipeline Inspection’s “Changes Since” Filter:</strong> This ingenious filter shows you how your opportunities have evolved from a specific point in time up to the present. It tracks changes to amounts, stages, forecast categories, and critically for our discussion: opportunities that have “Moved In” or “Moved Out” of your chosen forecast period.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-curious-case-of-the-elusive-opportunity">The Curious Case of the Elusive Opportunity</h3>
<p>Let’s set the stage with a very specific example, straight from a recent conversation:</p>
<p>Imagine it’s <strong>Sunday, June 15, 2025</strong>. You’re viewing your Pipeline Inspection dashboard, focused on the <strong>“This Quarter” (Q2: April 1 — June 30, 2025)</strong> forecast period.</p>
<p>You have an Opportunity with this history:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Original Close Date:</strong> July 4, 2025 (initially in Q3)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Change 1:</strong> On <strong>June 4, 2025</strong>, you moved its Close Date from July 4, 2025 <strong>to June 30, 2025</strong>. <em>(This moved the opportunity INTO “This Quarter”)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Change 2:</strong> On <strong>June 9, 2025</strong>, you moved its Close Date from June 30, 2025 <strong>to August 30, 2025</strong>. <em>(This moved the opportunity OUT of “This Quarter”)</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now for the baffling part: You observe that this opportunity <strong>shows up as “Moved Out” when you select ‘Changes Since: This Week’</strong>, but it <strong>does NOT show up when you select ‘Changes Since: 2 Weeks Ago’</strong>.</p>
<p>Why the inconsistency? Let’s unpack it.</p>
<h3 id="dissecting-the-filters-the-starting-point-is-everything">Dissecting the Filters: The “Starting Point” is Everything</h3>
<p>The key to understanding this lies in how Pipeline Inspection defines the <em>start</em> of each “Changes Since” window, and how it uses that starting point to determine “Moved In” or “Moved Out” status relative to your <strong>selected forecast period</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="filter-1-changes-since-thisweek">Filter 1: ‘Changes Since: This Week’</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it means:</strong> All changes that happened since the very beginning of the current calendar week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Our Start Time (for Sunday, June 15):</strong> Monday, June 9, 2025, 12:00:00 AM EDT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Analysis:<br>
**– <strong>At the start of this filter (June 9, 12 AM EDT):</strong> Our opportunity’s Close Date was <strong>June 30, 2025</strong>. This date falls <strong>inside</strong> “This Quarter” (April 1 — June 30).<br>
– <strong>During this filter’s window (on June 9):</strong> The Close Date was changed from June 30, 2025, to August 30, 2025. This new date falls <strong>outside</strong> “This Quarter”.<br>
– <strong>Result:</strong> The opportunity was <em>inside</em> “This Quarter” at the start of ‘This Week’ and then moved <em>outside</em> “This Quarter” during ‘This Week’. This perfectly fits the “Moved Out” criteria.<br>
– <strong>Verdict:</strong> <strong>It WILL show up as “Moved Out” in ‘This Week’. (Matches your observation!)</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="filter-2-changes-since-2-weeksago">Filter 2: ‘Changes Since: 2 Weeks Ago’</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it means:</strong> All changes that happened since exactly two weeks prior to the current moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Our Start Time (for Sunday, June 15, 5:53:15 PM EDT):</strong> Sunday, June 1, 2025, 5:53:15 PM EDT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Analysis:<br>
**– <strong>At the start of this filter (June 1, 5:53:15 PM EDT):</strong> Our opportunity’s Close Date was <strong>July 4, 2025</strong> (because the change to June 30 hadn’t happened yet, as it occurred on June 4).<br>
– Is July 4, 2025 <strong>within</strong> “This Quarter” (April 1 — June 30)? <strong>NO.</strong> (It’s in Q3).<br>
– <strong>Result:</strong> For an opportunity to be “Moved Out” by this filter, it needed to be <em>inside</em> “This Quarter” on June 1. Since it was <em>already outside</em> “This Quarter” at that starting point, it cannot be counted as having “moved out” <em>from that specific perspective</em>. Even though it moved in and then out <em>within</em> the 2-week window, its starting status for this particular filter disqualifies it from the “Moved Out” category.<br>
– <strong>Verdict:</strong> <strong>It will NOT show up as “Moved Out” in ‘2 Weeks Ago’. (Matches your observation!)</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-takeaway-its-all-about-thebaseline">The Takeaway: It’s All About the Baseline</h3>
<p>The critical lesson here is that Salesforce Pipeline Inspection’s “Moved In” and “Moved Out” metrics are calculated by comparing the opportunity’s status <strong>at the exact beginning of your chosen ‘Changes Since’ filter</strong> to its current status, all relative to your <strong>selected Forecast Period</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s not just about when a change happened, but what the opportunity’s state was <em>at the baseline of the comparison</em>. This allows sales managers to accurately understand pipeline dynamics from different historical vantage points.</p>
<p>So, the next time you’re reviewing your pipeline, remember the power of that “Changes Since” filter and how its starting point dictates the story it tells.</p>

<p>By the end of this article, you’ll understand how user automation in Salesforce CPQ and Experience Cloud can improve the partner experience, setting the stage for more in-depth discussions on portal setup and CPQ integration in the next parts of this series.</p>
<h3 id="use-casescenario">Use Case Scenario</h3>
<p>The goal is to enable a Contact as an Experience Cloud user (Partner portal) so that they can self-serve CPQ quotes and manage other CPQ-related activities using the Partner portal. Typically, user access is managed by an admin through User administration. However, for Experience Cloud users, the process is slightly different. Instead of creating a user record through Setup, you enable it directly through the Contact record.</p>
<p>To set up a Partner user, a Salesforce user needs the ‘Manage External Users’ permission. You also need to add specific buttons and actions on the Contact and Account objects to grant external users access. Usually, this is done manually, but it can be automated for efficiency. In this article, we’ll focus on automating this process using Salesforce Flows.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Users need Salesforce CPQ licenses specifically configured for partner use. This includes the Salesforce CPQ for Partners permission set, ensuring that partners can utilize CPQ functionalities such as creating and managing quotes​.</p>
<p>Now, let’s dive into some action!</p>
<p><strong>Flow Design</strong></p>
<p>Due to a known Salesforce limitation with <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_dml_non_mix_sobjects.htm">Mixed DML operations</a>, we can’t update non-setup objects (like Account and Contact) and setup objects (like User) in a single flow. However, we can work around this by processing the requests asynchronously using two separate flows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Autolaunched No Trigger Flow</strong>: This flow handles the creation of User records and assigning permissions/licenses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Record-Triggered After Save Flow</strong>: This flow triggers the above flow as a sub-flow from the Contact record and ensures any necessary validations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By using these two flows, we can effectively manage the process without running into Salesforce’s limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Autolaunched No Trigger Flow</strong></p>
<p>Start with creating a few variables that will be used as input in the record-triggered flow.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>contactId: A Text Variable to accept Contact Id that’s ‘Available for input’ outside of the flow, to be used as an input in the record-triggered flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>userId: A Text Variable that’s ‘Available for input’ outside of the flow, to be used to store the User Id after creating the user record and then pass it to assign license and permission set in the same flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create two formula resources for Alias and Nickname in user record creation. These two fields on user record are required and should be unique. You can come up with you own logic, but a simple formula is to get the first letter of first name and concatenate with last name (of the contact. To get the contact’s first and last names, we will use the Get Record element).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the required variables are created, let’s add the following elements to the flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Get Records (Contact Object):</strong> To get the contact record for which the partner user has to be created.<br>
<strong>- Filter Conditions:</strong> All Conditions are Met (And): Id = contactId (variable created above); Leave the rest to default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get Records (Profile Object):</strong> To get the Profile that has to be assigned to the user during User record creation.<br>
<strong>- Filter Conditions:</strong> All Conditions are Met (And): Name = Partner Community User (Adjust accordingly to the profile name you have created); Leave the rest to default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get Records (Permission Set Object):</strong> To get the CPQ Partner User Permission Set that has to be assigned to the user after User record creation.<br>
<strong>- Filter Conditions:</strong> All Conditions are Met (And): Label = CPQ Partner User (Adjust accordingly to the permission set name you have created); Leave the rest to default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create Records (User Object):</strong> To create the user record using the contact Id from above. There a number of required fields for creating a user, I will only list a few here.<br>
<strong>- How to Set record field values:</strong> Manually<br>
- <strong>Create a Record of This Object:</strong> User<br>
- <strong>Set Field Values for the User: <br>
 —</strong> Alias = Alias formula variable from above<br>
 — CommunityNickname = Nickname formula variable from above<br>
 — ContactId = {!GetContact.Id} (From Get Contact records element above)<br>
 — Email, first Name, Last Name from the Get Contact records element above<br>
 — Username: I have assigned the email as user name (by referencing to Get Contact records element), but you can adjust based on your needs.<br>
 — ProfileId = Profile Id from Get Profile records element above<br>
- Store the User Id in the UserId variable created above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Get Records (Permission Set License Object):</strong> To get the Id of Salesforce CPQ License and then assign to the user created above in the next step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create Records (for License assignment):</strong> To assign the permission set license using the Id from above Get records element.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create Records (for Permission Set assignment):</strong> To assign the permission set (Partner CPQ Permission set) using the Id from above Get records element.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>![Flow Summary](<a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1</a>*I4xxZOtbmqvBFMVtgjZWCw.png align=&ldquo;center&rdquo;)</p>
<p>That’s it! You are 75% done with the user creation. Next let’s get the record triggered after save flow set up.</p>
<p>Note that the same flow with minor changes can be used for automating Customer community portal user creation or general Salesforce platform user creation.</p>
<p><strong>Record-Triggered After Save Flow</strong></p>
<p>Next create a Record-Triggered flow on Contact object whenever a contact is created or updated. As we cannot have every contact that’s created or updated to be an Experience cloud user (partner portal user in this case), we need a condition to trigger. In my case, I have created a checkbox called Experience Cloud user on the contact object. This flow will only be triggered if this checkbox is checked.</p>
<h4 id="important-step-as-mentioned-earlier-due-to-the-mixed-dml-operations-limitation-now-is-the-time-to-address-this-in-theflow">Important step: As mentioned earlier, due to the mixed DML operations limitation, now is the time to address this in the flow.</h4>
<p>Scroll to the bottom of the ‘Configure Start’ and check the checkbox ‘Include a Run Asynchronously Run path….’, which will add a new path to the start element. One path that runs immediately and the other async. Or you can leverage a schedule path as well.</p>
<p>Below is the screenshot for your reference.</p>
<p>![](<a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1</a>*WCKx1thWfIs7JF8UeeDoqw.png align=&ldquo;center&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Start Configuration</p>
<p>In the Run immediately path you can include Update the related account’s IsPartner field to true and any validations that should trigger when the checkbox (experience cloud user) is checked — like checking if an email address is present on the contact or not.</p>
<p>In the Run async path, call the Autolaunched no trigger flow as a Subflow with ContactId set as Triggering Contact’s Contact Id.</p>
<p>![Flow Summary](<a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1</a>*VdbWLTKG6bm4SU4TtCXk1w.png align=&ldquo;center&rdquo;)</p>
<p>Voila! That’s all. You have now mastered automation of user record creation through flows and without a single line of apex code.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think of this and any other ideas on how you have achieved this.</p>
<p>In the next part, I’ll cover setting up Experience Cloud with the CPQ Quote object, specifically focusing on the Quote Line Editor.</p>

These improvements simplify usage and effectively address complex requirements that cannot be met through declarative means.</p>
<p>Did you know you can now implement cross-object validation rules without writing Apex code?</p>
<p>Until now, if you needed to check related records, like verifying their existence or displaying error messages to prevent record deletion in specific scenarios, or developers had to rely on Apex code.</p>
<p>In the Winter ’24 release, Salesforce introduced a valuable feature: Custom Error Messages as a Flow Element. This feature offers administrators and developers a practical solution to improve error handling and guide users effectively through Salesforce Flows. Let’s delve into the details of this feature, understand how to utilize it, consider important factors, and explore an illustrative example.</p>
<h4 id="use-casescenario"><strong>Use Case Scenario</strong></h4>
<p>The requirement is to make certain address fields on the Account object conditionally required based on the billing country selected. Specifically, either the State/Province field or the Postal Code/Zip Code field should be required based on the selected billing country. Additionally, in some cases, both the State/Province and Postal Code/Zip Code fields may need to be required.</p>
<p>Traditionally, you’d handle this by creating a complex Validation Rule using nested AND, OR statements or CASE functions to check the selected country and set validation criteria for State/Province and Postal Code/Zip Code fields. Another option is using an Apex trigger. But using Validation Rules can be tricky because they’re hard to maintain, especially when you need to change or update certain criteria.</p>
<p>Let’s see how this can be solved using a record-trigger Flow.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Metadata Type</strong></p>
<p>Create a Custom Metadata Type tailored for storing essential details like Country name, State/Province requirement, and Zip Code requirement. Next, simplify data import by uploading a CSV file containing information for the 50+ countries directly into the Custom Metadata Type.</p>
<p>Below is a sample of the CSV file.</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Country__c</th>
          <th>Zip_Required__c</th>
          <th>State_Required__c</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>CA</td>
          <td>Canada</td>
          <td>No</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>US</td>
          <td>United States</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>No</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>IN</td>
          <td>India</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Flow Design</strong></p>
<p>Create a Record Trigger flow on Account object, that’s triggered when a record is created or updated that’s optimized for fast field updates and no conditions. Then add a Get Record element that references to the above created CMTD with country name equals to record’s BillingCountry.</p>
<p>Add a Decision element with condition outcomes to check and compare if Zip or State or both are required when a specific field on Account is null.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to add the Custom Error element! For each of the decision outcome, add Custom Error element. Here are a couple of screenshots of Custom Error element.</p>
<p>Either the error message can be displayed as an inline error or in a window. Note that you can add multiple error messages for one Custom Error element.</p>
<p>![](<a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1</a>*Agf9RXnRI1BM6vFPw7x4jg.png align=&ldquo;center&rdquo;)</p>

<p>Save and Activate the flow.Flow with Custom Error Element</p>

<p>Voilà! You have now added a custom error without a single line of Apex code or a complex Validation Rule! Now let’s test this out.</p>
<p>![Custom Error Validation on New Account creation](<a href="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1">https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1</a>*HvY8VQ_HauBbxRt1AmZJyg.gif align=&ldquo;center&rdquo;)</p>
<h3 id="considerations">Considerations</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Custom Error element can contain only one record page error message. To create another record page error message in the same flow, use another Custom error element.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A field can have only one error message, but each field can have an error message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compound fields aren’t supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an executed fault path has a Custom Error element, the change that triggered the flow is rolled back.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Custom error messages use the same functionality as the addError() Id method in Apex.</p>
</li>
