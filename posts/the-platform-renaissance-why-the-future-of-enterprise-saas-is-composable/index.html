The costs, maintenance, and complexity of custom systems made SaaS the pragmatic choice.\nBut a shift is underway. Enterprises are beginning to ask a deeper question:\nWhat if the real power isn’t in the cloud you buy — but in the platform beneath it?\nWhy Now This shift is being driven by two major industry-wide transformations:\n1. The Maturing of In-House Talent Ten years ago, large engineering teams were mostly found in tech companies.\nToday — banks, retailers, manufacturers, insurers, logistics companies — every enterprise is a technology company.\nThis is fueling the Platform Engineering megatrend.\nGartner predicts that by 2026,\n80% of large software engineering organizations will establish platform engineering teams.(Gartner — Top Strategic Technology Trends)\nThese teams build Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs) to standardize how enterprise engineers build systems internally. They’re no longer simple “software consumers” — they’re sophisticated builders.\nGartner has also continued to advocate for composable architecture, aligned to modularity, speed, and reuse.\nAnd another key data point:\nBy 2027, 50% of enterprise software engineers will use ML-powered coding tools. (Gartner — Software Engineering Trends)\n2. The Rise of AI as a Developer Generative AI is completely reshaping the economics of software development.\nAI now:\nWrites large portions of production-grade code\nBuilds tests\nGenerates documentation\nImproves code quality\nReduces long-term maintenance overhead\nThe old barriers that made “Build” expensive are eroding quickly.\nAI means that building is no longer a high-cost, long-term liability — it’s becoming a strategic advantage, especially when the solution differentiates your business.\nNot Just a Return to “Build vs. Buy” Some frame this shift as reopening the old debate. But this is bigger. This is not “Build” versus “Buy.” This is a new model:\nBuy the Platform. Build the Differentiation.\nWe are entering the Platform Renaissance, aligned with what Gartner calls the Composable Enterprise — a world where organizations assemble capabilities like Lego blocks.\nThe AI-Powered Platform-First Opportunity The future of enterprise IT isn’t in vertical SaaS apps. It’s in platforms that empower organizations to build what truly differentiates them. SaaS vendors can evolve by offering:\nHorizontal Capabilities: Workflow engines, Analytics, AI automation\nExtensible building blocks: data models, UI templates, SDKs\nOpen composition: customers assemble apps themselves\nInstead of selling Service Cloud v3, vendors could provide: A secure, metadata-driven, AI-native platform where enterprise engineers and citizen developers build their own solutions — fast. This enables enterprises to:\nMaintain innovation speed\nAvoid vendor lock-in\nReduce expensive custom rebuilds\nUse vendor strengths while building unique IP\nGartner — Top Strategic Technology Trends for 2026: Composable Platforms \u0026 AI-Native Development\nThe New Opportunity: Unbundle, Don’t Replace This shift isn’t about discarding existing systems.\nIt’s about unbundling them.\nA very telling example: A recent job posting for a Salesforce Developer (AI/Einstein) didn’t simply ask for app admin skills. It asked for the ability to:\n“Design, build, and productionize Salesforce-native AI features and Build on-platform AI capabilities”\nThat job description reflects what enterprises actually want from SaaS vendors today —\nGive us your governance, security, reliability, and world-class AI stack.\nAnd give us the freedom to build the last-mile differentiation ourselves.\nSaaS vendors that pivot from “product providers” to platform enablers will define the next decade of enterprise software.\nThey will become the foundation layer for AI-driven, customizable enterprise applications.\nVendors Best Positioned to Lead Salesforce: Already progressing toward a metadata-first, AI-native extensible platform.\nMicrosoft: Power Platform + Azure offer some of the strongest building-block primitives in the market.\nServiceNow: Now Platform increasingly resembles a modular business OS.\nOracle: Fusion Cloud + Oracle’s developer tooling make it a strong contender for platform-driven enterprise architectures.\n“The future of enterprise IT isn’t just what you buy.\nIt’s what you can build on top of it.”\nThe next decade of enterprise software won’t be defined by the tools we buy, but by the platforms we build upon.\nThe real question for CIOs, architects, and product leaders now is simple:\nWill your organization be a consumer of SaaS — or a creator of strategic advantage?\nNote: This article was written by the author with editing assistance from AI \u0026 Illustrations generated with the help of AI\n","wordCount":"735","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9rA7cZugEHvJ-Bk0o17w8Q.png","datePublished":"2025-11-22T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-11-22T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/the-platform-renaissance-why-the-future-of-enterprise-saas-is-composable/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Pavan Chavali","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://pchavali09.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://pchavali09.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Pavan Chavali (Alt + H)">Pavan Chavali</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
