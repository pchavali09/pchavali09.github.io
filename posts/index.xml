&lt;p&gt;If you’ve read &lt;a href="https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/episode1-apis-ai-mcp/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episode 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you probably remember how we opened the door to this new world of &lt;strong&gt;AI MCP (Model Context Protocol)&lt;/strong&gt; — the idea that systems could start reasoning, not just integrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt exciting, futuristic… maybe &lt;em&gt;too good to be true&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
And honestly, that’s what I’ve been thinking about ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because like most of you who’ve lived through long integration nights, broken APIs, and “mysterious” data mismatches — I’ve learned that &lt;em&gt;every shiny new thing&lt;/em&gt; comes with its own set of “gotchas.”&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Platform Renaissance: Why the Future of Enterprise SaaS Is Composable</title><link>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/platform-renaissance/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/platform-renaissance/</guid><description>

&lt;p&gt;For nearly two decades, the enterprise IT playbook has been clear and consistent. In the “Build vs. Buy” debate, the answer overwhelmingly leaned toward &lt;strong&gt;Buy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We adopted Salesforce, Workday, ServiceNow, and other SaaS platforms because they were secure, scalable, and significantly cheaper and faster than building enterprise systems from scratch. The costs, maintenance, and complexity of custom systems made SaaS the pragmatic choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a shift is underway. Enterprises are beginning to ask a deeper question:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Episode 1: From APIs to AI MCP — The Next Chapter of Enterprise Integrations</title><link>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/episode-1-apis-to-ai-mcp/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/episode-1-apis-to-ai-mcp/</guid><description>

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever spent late nights debugging APIs, juggling integration flows, or wondering why your “connected systems” don’t actually &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; to each other — this one’s for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This 4-part series explores how enterprise integrations are evolving from traditional APIs and middleware to something smarter — &lt;strong&gt;AI MCP (Model Context Protocol)&lt;/strong&gt; — a new way for systems to communicate &lt;em&gt;intelligently&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(In this first episode, we’ll explore what MCP is, why it matters, and how it changes the way we think about integration.)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Rise of the Agentic Enterprise: How Salesforce’s Agentforce 360 Is Changing Work Forever</title><link>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/agentic-enterprise/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/agentic-enterprise/</guid><description>

&lt;p&gt;When Salesforce announced Agentforce in 2024, it felt like a glimpse into the future of AI in the enterprise. Fast forward to Dreamforce 2025, and that vision has evolved — now it’s about Agentforce 360 and something Salesforce calls the Agentic Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Agentforce 360 connects AI agents, humans, data, and workflows to elevate human potential in the age of AI.”&lt;br&gt;
 —&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/10/13/agentic-enterprise-announcement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salesforce Press Release, Dreamforce 2025&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it sounds like another big buzzword moment. But if you look closer, Salesforce is signalling something much deeper — a shift from “AI features” to AI teammates that work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; us, not just &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; us.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I Built an AI “Copilot” to Automate My Most Annoying Task: Logging Emails in Salesforce</title><link>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/email-automation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/email-automation/</guid><description>

&lt;p&gt;Every professional who uses a CRM has felt this pain. You finish an important email exchange with a client — full of critical details, action items, and subtle sentiment cues — and then comes the administrative tax: logging it all in Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You copy and paste, you try to summarize the key points, you search for the right Account or Opportunity, and you create a Task. It’s a tedious, time-consuming process that’s universally disliked yet essential for maintaining a clear customer record.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mastering Salesforce Pipeline: Effective Use of Preset &amp; Side Panel Filters</title><link>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/salesforce-pipeline-episode-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/salesforce-pipeline-episode-1/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;Ever found yourself in Salesforce Pipeline Inspection, meticulously applying filters at the top of the page, only to open the “Show Filters” panel on the right (that handy three-lines icon) and see it unchanged? It’s a common point of confusion: why don’t these filter sections seem to “talk” to each other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve experienced this, you’re not alone. This behaviour isn’t a bug; it’s a deliberate design choice by Salesforce that, once understood, can unlock a more powerful and intuitive pipeline analysis experience. Let’s break down the distinct roles of these two filter areas and how to master their interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using the "Changes Since" Filter for Better Salesforce Pipeline Inspection</title><link>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/salesforce-pipeline-episode-2/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/salesforce-pipeline-episode-2/</guid><description>
&lt;p&gt;Ever found yourself staring at your Salesforce Pipeline Inspection dashboard, scratching your head? You know a deal moved, but it’s not showing up where you expect it to. Or perhaps it appears under “This Week” but vanishes when you select “2 Weeks Ago”?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds familiar, you’re not alone. Pipeline Inspection is a powerful tool for sales leaders and reps, offering dynamic insights into pipeline health. But its “Changes Since” filter, particularly how it calculates “Moved In” and “Moved Out” opportunities, can sometimes feel like a magic trick. Today, we’re pulling back the curtain on that magic, using a real-world scenario to explain exactly what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Improve Partner Collaboration Using Salesforce: Master User Automation</title><link>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/partner-collaboration/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/partner-collaboration/</guid><description>

&lt;p&gt;In today’s fast-paced business world, working efficiently with partners is essential. Salesforce CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote) and Experience Cloud together can greatly improve the way partners interact with your business. This three-part series will show you how these tools can make partner interactions smoother and more productive. We’ll start by focusing on user automation in the first part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In “Mastering User Automation,” we’ll look at how automating user-related tasks can save time and reduce mistakes. Key features we’ll cover include setting up user accounts automatically, automating workflows, and sending customized notifications. These tools ensure partners get the right access at the right time, making things easier for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Guide to Using Salesforce Flows for Cross Object Validation</title><link>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/salesforce-flows-automation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/salesforce-flows-automation/</guid><description>

&lt;p&gt;Salesforce consistently enhances Flows with each release, transforming them into a more robust and user-friendly feature. These improvements simplify usage and effectively address complex requirements that cannot be met through declarative means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can now implement cross-object validation rules without writing Apex code?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, if you needed to check related records, like verifying their existence or displaying error messages to prevent record deletion in specific scenarios, or developers had to rely on Apex code.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Unveiling the Power of Salesforce Experience Cloud in Digital Transformation</title><link>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/unveiling-the-power-of-salesforce-experience-cloud-in-digital-transformation-43a2c0abd91b/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pchavali09.github.io/posts/unveiling-the-power-of-salesforce-experience-cloud-in-digital-transformation-43a2c0abd91b/</guid><description>
